================================================================================
1. GLOBAL STYLE RULES — APPLY TO EVERY PROMPT
================================================================================

Add these keywords/instructions to EVERY prompt you submit:

  "16-bit pixel art, top-down RPG perspective, bright and cheerful colors,
   child-friendly cartoon style, clean pixel edges, transparent background,
   no anti-aliasing, limited color palette (max 32 colors per sprite),
   inspired by Stardew Valley and Pokémon gen 3-4 art style"

Resolution rules:
  - Generate at 3x size (e.g., 144x144 for a 48x48 tile) for best quality
  - Downscale to target size in Aseprite using nearest-neighbor interpolation
  - NEVER use bilinear/bicubic downscale — it blurs pixel art
  - Export as PNG with transparency (alpha channel)
  - SpriteKit expects @1x (48px), @2x (96px), @3x (144px) variants

Color palette reference (use these exact colors for consistency):
  - Grass green:    #72C059
  - Path tan:       #C0A673
  - Water blue:     #4D8DD9
  - Wall brown:     #734552 (really a dark mauve-brown)
  - Wood brown:     #A67340
  - Stone gray:     #999999
  - Dirt brown:     #8C6640
  - Sand yellow:    #F2E6A6
  - Snow white:     #F2F2FF
  - Lab light gray: #D9D9E6
  - Portal purple:  #B366FF
  - Skin tone:      #FFD9BA
  - Hair brown:     #472E1A
  - Shirt blue:     #4785E6
  - Pants navy:     #333F6B
  - Shoe red:       #D13830

Art style details:
  - Characters have large heads (roughly 60-70% of body width)
  - Eyes are large and expressive (anime-influenced but not full anime)
  - Bodies are short and chibi-proportioned (head:body ratio ~1:1)
  - Outlines are 1px dark (not black — use darkened version of fill color)
  - Shading uses 2-3 tones per color area (base + shadow + optional highlight)
  - No dithering — use flat color fills with clear tone boundaries
  - All characters cast a small dark elliptical shadow beneath their feet


================================================================================

For @2x and @3x variants, append the suffix:
  player_idle_down.png      (1x — 48x64)
  player_idle_down@2x.png   (2x — 96x128)
  player_idle_down@3x.png   (3x — 144x192)

9. EXPORT CHECKLIST — VERIFY BEFORE IMPORTING TO XCODE
================================================================================

For EVERY exported asset, verify:

  [ ] PNG format with alpha transparency
  [ ] Correct pixel dimensions (no off-by-one)
  [ ] No stray pixels outside the sprite boundary
  [ ] No anti-aliased (blurry) edges — all edges are crisp 1px steps
  [ ] Color palette matches the global palette above
  [ ] Character sprites are CENTERED in the frame horizontally
  [ ] Character feet are near the BOTTOM of the frame (with ~2px padding)
  [ ] Character heads are near the TOP of the frame (with ~2px padding)
  [ ] Walk animation frames have CONSISTENT body size (no size flickering)
  [ ] Walk animation frames have feet at the SAME Y position when grounded
  [ ] Tiles connect seamlessly when placed side-by-side (check all 4 edges)
  [ ] Shadow ellipse is included and positioned consistently across all frames
  [ ] Filename matches the naming convention exactly (case-sensitive)
  [ ] @1x, @2x, @3x variants are all present and correctly sized

Quick test in Aseprite:
  1. Open all 4 walk frames for one direction as animation
  2. Play at 6-7 FPS — should look like smooth walking, no jitter
  3. Place 4 grass tiles in a 2x2 grid — edges should connect seamlessly
  4. Place character on top of tiles — character should be clearly visible
     against the background with good contrast

  END OF PROMPT GUIDE
  Total assets needed for initial art pass:
    Tiles:     ~25 individual tiles
    Player:    20 frames (4 dirs x 5 frames)
    Buddies:   24 frames x 4 buddies = 96 frames
    NPCs:      4-8 frames per NPC x 3 NPCs = ~16 frames
    Props:     ~12 individual props
    UI:        ~12 icons/frames
    -----------------------------------------
    TOTAL:     ~180 individual PNG files

  Estimated time with PixelLab:
    - Tiles: 1-2 hours (batch generation + seamless fix)
    - Player: 2-3 hours (establish style + all frames)
    - Each buddy: 2-3 hours
    - NPCs: 1-2 hours
    - Props: 1-2 hours
    - UI: 1 hour
    TOTAL: ~15-20 hours of art generation + cleanup
